# Blockplay: portable agent handoff

**Latest: sectors, piloted on HarbourFront (2026-09-20).** A district has until
now been one uniform tactical unit: `risk`, `lootTier`, `botCount` and the loot
rules are per-district scalars, and the six `encounterSpawns` do double duty as
bot spawns and loot anchors (`fps-engine.ts:127`). So a map had no interior
structure any system could read, even though every zone description already
names two or three places in prose. `src/game/zone-sectors.ts` is that structure:
named sub-areas with bounds, a cover character, loot and patrol weights, a tier
bias and curated anchors.

Data only so far — nothing consumes it yet. The consumers are loot allocation
(weight the `kinds` array across sectors, which needs its own RNG stream or it
breaks the existing "contents and positions are separate streams" guarantee),
patrol seeding in `createArena`, minimap tinting via the existing `decor`
rects, and a sector-name callout on crossing.

Sectors live in their own module rather than in the scene files, for the reason
the zone spawns do: `world-zones.ts` and `zone-sectors.ts` stay free of three.js,
and the test builds the real scene so a geometry change cannot silently wall a
sector off.

Two things worth keeping. **Cover labels must be measured, not eyeballed** —
`measureSectorCover` samples usable cover (anything under 1.5 m is a lamp post,
not cover) and `coverFor` bands it; the test holds every declared label to it.
Three of nine hand-written labels were wrong, including Keppel wharf, which was
declared `dense` on the strength of its gantries and measures **4% solid**. That
is a real finding, not a naming slip: the zone description promises "the wharf
end has cover" and the geometry does not deliver it. The fix is deepening the
container stack, not a kinder label. **Telok Blangah green measures 0% usable
cover** — four tree trunks — so arriving from the Queenstown checkpoint means
arriving in the open.

HarbourFront now reads 2 dense / 2 broken / 5 open, which is coherent with its
`risk: high` rating: it is dangerous because there is nowhere to hide, not
because it is crowded.

353 unit tests (+6) and typecheck pass; build not re-run as nothing touched the
Vite config, entrypoints or worker, and browser/FPS smokes still not run here.

**Note on the branch.** `CLAUDE.md` says to commit straight to `main`, but
`origin/main` is 25 commits behind this branch and does not contain
`harbourfront-scene.ts` — sixteen of the nineteen districts, and the CLAUDE.md
workflow note itself, exist only here. Pushing this to `main` would not compile.
`main` can fast-forward cleanly (no divergence), but that deploys 25 commits, so
it is the owner's call.

**Latest: Bukit Timah and Bishan (2026-09-20).** Nineteen districts, 209
stamps. These close the two thin regions the last coverage pass left: the
north-west and the north-east belt. One district each rather than one per town
— Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang and Clementi are much the same as each other,
and so are Ang Mo Kio, Hougang and Sengkang; Bukit Timah and Bishan are the
ones with distinct material.

Bukit Timah brings the first real topography: a ridge terracing up to a trig
marker, the old rail corridor on ballast and sleepers crossing the road on a
Warren-web truss, and black-and-white bungalows on pier undercrofts.

Bishan added a pattern worth reusing. Every channel before it was an
axis-aligned rectangle or a list of them, which a meander cannot be; its river
is a chain of short boxes stepped along a sine curve, overlapping so the chain
collides as one continuous bank while each box stays axis-aligned. The
gap-at-every-street rule still applies to the chain. `docs/DISTRICTS.md` records
it, since it is the general answer to curved water.

Coverage now: 79% of the mainland north-south, 80% east-west, mean
nearest-neighbour 3.8 km, every planning region represented. Bedok and Pasir
Ris are the only named towns still unbuilt, and Tampines carries that region.
347 unit tests, typecheck and build pass; browser and FPS smokes still not run
here.

**Earlier: the three coverage gaps filled (2026-09-20).** Seventeen districts,
187 stamps. Woodlands, Tampines and Toa Payoh close the three holes the
coverage review named. Woodlands puts the causeway and its checkpoint across
the strait, crossed in exactly two places, both gaps in the water rather than
decks over it. Tampines has the round market — a drum of outward stall bays
under a radial roof — with a banked stadium bowl and a filled quarry. Toa Payoh
is the first-generation new town the set lacked: balcony access decks, a
Y-plan point block, the mosaic dragon and the spiral park lookout. Queenstown
is no longer the only housing estate.

Watch the FPS district test, not just regions.test: Tampines passed the region
bar but failed `fps-districts.test.ts`, whose sightline and helicopter
climb-out checks caught scrub and a tree crown laid through the practice range.
And `region-selection.test.ts` had used 'tampines' as its example of an unbuilt
district, which building one quietly falsified; it now names places kept off
the roadmap.

Coverage after this: the remaining thin spots are the north-west (Choa Chu
Kang, Bukit Panjang, Clementi, Bukit Timah) and the north-east belt (Ang Mo
Kio, Hougang, Sengkang, Serangoon). Bedok and Pasir Ris are still unbuilt in
the east, though Tampines now represents it.

**Earlier: Tuas (2026-09-20).** Fourteen districts, 154 stamps. Added after a
coverage review showed nine of thirteen districts sat within 6 km of Raffles
Place, with nothing at all in the far west. Tuas is the first district with no
housing or shopfronts in it: tank farms behind bunds, trayed columns under a
guyed flare, a pipe rack with an expansion loop, a stepped dry dock with a hull
on keel blocks, rail stacking gantries over container rows, and a pylon run
down the eastern aisle. The strait sits outside the perimeter loop so no street
runs into it, and the Tuas Link terminus rides over the coast road on piers
rather than blocking it. Links to Jurong Lake only — it is the end of the
island. 317 unit tests, typecheck and build pass; browser and FPS smokes still
not run here.

Coverage after this: the north is still empty (no Woodlands, Sembawang,
Yishun), as are the eastern heartlands (Bedok, Tampines, Pasir Ris) and the
mature HDB belt (Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Toa Payoh). Queenstown remains the only
housing estate, and it is the atypical heritage one.

**Earlier: scene code-splitting measured, then dropped (2026-09-20).** The
standing follow-up — every scene builder statically imported, so all districts
ship in the main bundle — was measured rather than acted on, and is not worth
doing. Cold load is 412 kB gzipped: 241 kB `index` plus 181 kB `three`. Each
district costs ~4 kB gzipped (measured: six districts added 25 kB), so all
thirteen are ~54 kB, and splitting still loads whichever district you enter, so
the real saving is ~50 kB **once**, on a cold visit, against filenames that are
content-hashed and cached indefinitely after that.

Against that: `build()` is synchronous and called from `RegionGame`,
`district-world.ts` and `fps-engine.ts`, so splitting makes it async through the
FPS startup path; and the expedition crosses checkpoints between districts at
runtime, which is instant today and would become a fetch on each first
crossing. Prefetching neighbours to avoid the stall gives the saving back. If
bundle size ever matters, `three` is 44% of the total and is the only target
worth attacking — and measure time-to-interactive first.

**Earlier: Geylang (2026-09-20).** Thirteen districts are playable, 143 stamps.
The lorong grid is the district: six close-set numbered lanes at 56-metre
spacing, terraces turned outward onto them with a back lane between, and a
canal along the rear bridged at every lane. It links Kampong Glam to Changi,
which is the first time a new district has been slotted between two existing
ones rather than hung off the end. 310 unit tests, typecheck and the build
pass; browser and FPS smokes still not run here.

**Earlier: five more authored districts (2026-09-20).** Twelve districts were
playable, 132 stamps. Upper Thomson, Punggol, HarbourFront, Sentosa and Orchard
Road were added on the existing platform — a registry entry plus a scene file
each, with no change to `RegionGame.tsx`, the minimaps or the harness. All five
were authored from general knowledge with **no reference capture and no Google
API requests**, so nine of the twelve now record an empty `referenceFeatures`
list and only Marina, Raffles and Queenstown are reference-informed. Three new
checkpoint pairs link them in: Chinatown to Orchard to Upper Thomson to Punggol
to Changi, and Queenstown to HarbourFront to Sentosa, which is reachable only
across its boardwalk. Water is now cast as a list of spans wherever a road has
to cross it, and HarbourFront's middle street is laid by hand so it stops at
the quay; `docs/DISTRICTS.md` has both patterns. 304 unit tests, typecheck and
the production build pass; the browser and FPS smokes have not been run in this
environment (they need Vite plus Chrome with remote debugging). The main bundle
is now 711 kB / 238 kB gzipped, since every scene builder is still statically
imported.

**Earlier: four authored districts and a region platform (2026-09-19).** Seven
districts are playable. Adding one is now a registry entry in
`src/game/regions.ts` plus a scene file built with `src/game/scene-kit.ts`;
`RegionGame.tsx` is the single walk/drive harness and `regions.test.ts` holds
every district to the same reachability, drivable-road and batching bar.
Chinatown, Kampong Glam, Jurong Lake and Changi were authored from general
knowledge with **no reference capture and no Google API requests**, and record
an empty `referenceFeatures` list; they have no learning cards and no guide
panel. Read `docs/DISTRICTS.md` before adding or describing a district. 274
tests, build and a seven-district browser smoke pass.

**Latest: counter-fire freeze fix (2026-09-13).** Reproduced the first incoming-shot line-of-sight check crashing the frame loop: floating vehicle label sprites were included in camera-free raycasts, but `Sprite.raycast` requires a camera. Opening audio only coincided with the first attack. Vehicle labels now opt out of raycasting; physical vehicles remain cover. Added a regression using the actual vehicle scene and `test:fps:counter-fire`, which passes repeated damage, movement and Escape checks in all three districts with no uncaught errors or live map requests. 240 unit tests and Cloudflare build/dry run pass.

**Latest: simultaneous mouse aim/fire fix (2026-09-13).** Reproduced RMB-held then LMB missing fire: pointer events report only the first mouse press/final release in a button chord. Shared FPS engine now uses captured `mousedown`/`mouseup` for independent mouse buttons; touch/pen drag remains on pointer events, Q retains its own aim latch, and mouse handlers ignore AI control. Disposal removes both new listeners. Expanded `test:fps:aim-toggle` reproduces the failure before the fix and passes both press/release orders, repeated LMB firing under held RMB, no stuck fire/aim, Q+RMB coexistence, reload/switch/pause reset and AI isolation with eight targets cleared. Single-click test waits for ammo change instead of a short VM-sensitive sleep. 239 unit tests and Cloudflare build/dry run passed.

**Latest: Cloudflare deployment setup (2026-09-13).** Added Workers static assets plus the existing Node companion through `cloudflare:node`, same-origin HTTPS validation, API-first routing and `/api/health`. `pnpm build:cloudflare`, `check:cloudflare`, `preview:cloudflare`, `deploy:cloudflare` and `test:cloudflare` are ready. The cloud build keeps companions/LLM strategy available, offers Solo arena, and disables unsupported LAN host/join; local LAN and the static Sites build retain their behavior. Wrangler 4.127.1 is pinned with pnpm 11 and the unchanged two-week cooldown; workerd's binary installation is allowed. Private keys use Worker secrets; local preview reads only `.dev.vars`. **239 tests, cloud build/dry run, local workerd routing/model/audio smoke and production browser Queenstown FPS/pointer-lock/minimap checks passed.** Local verification used no paid service calls. Published directly to **https://blockplay-sg.sunjc826.workers.dev** in the user-selected Sunjc826 account; config pins that account. Uploaded the existing OpenAI key as a private Worker secret. Live asset/API smoke and browser Queenstown FPS/capture/minimap checks passed; one real LLM pilot request returned HTTP 200 with a valid resupply goal. No GitHub integration or repo admin access was needed. Setup and GitHub build settings are in [Cloudflare deployment](../docs/CLOUDFLARE.md).

**Latest: direct FPS in all three districts (2026-09-13).** Queenstown FPS and Raffles FPS now sit alongside Marina FPS. Each loads its actual scene, eight targets, regional spawn/props/car/helicopter, bounds and minimap through shared district configuration/world construction. Switching maps in FPS keeps that mode and starts a fresh range; armory/deploy returns to the selected map. Weapons/ADS/reload, counter-fire, XP, recordings, debug controls and fullscreen use the shared engine. Vehicle movement/dismount accept regional bounds; new-map flight clearance uses static mesh/instance bounds including raised structures. LAN arena stays Marina; expedition's existing world import forwards to the shared factory. **236 tests and production build pass after rebasing onto `origin/main` (`e2f2de1`)**, plus browser checks for all 24 targets with captured mouse fire, map/armory/minimap switching, one active scene, and both new maps' car drive/brake/exit, helicopter takeoff/land/exit guard, fullscreen and mobile layout. No live map/TTS requests. An exploratory Queenstown AI-pilot run stalled at 5/8; manual play clears all eight. Record this as an existing aiming/reacquisition limitation, not a successful AI completion. See [FPS districts](../docs/FPS-DISTRICTS.md). Rebase completed, preserving upstream companion safeguards and the pilot route; all three maps' captured-fire browser checks passed again against the combined version. No push.

**Latest: Encik manifest import fix (2026-09-13).** Moved the canonical manifest from `public/audio/encik/` to `src/audio/encik/manifest.json`; runtime/tests now import it from source, and the batch generator writes future manifests there. MP3s and listening page remain served from `public/audio/encik/`. Verified the actual Vite dev module transform has no public-directory import warning, two recording tests and five mocked batch checks pass, and production build passes. No audio regenerated or credits spent.

**Latest: approved Encik voice and full batch (2026-09-13).** User selected round 4 candidate 3 (then round 4 #1, round 3 #1) and authorized the full batch. Saved the chosen synthetic voice and generated all 48 existing callouts with Eleven v3, preserving subtitle text. Committed assets live in `public/audio/encik/` with hashed filenames, manifest and listening page. Total 2,534,088 bytes / 157 seconds; all 48 decode and are non-silent. Batch cost **776 credits**, matching response receipts and subscription delta; total **1,266/40,000** including auditions. The shared FPS engine now plays bundled MP3s for human/AI events; eight-buffer cache, priority interruption and late fetch/decode cancellation on mute/pause/reset/disposal. Captions/comms survive mute or load failure. No gameplay API key or installed-voice fallback. **220 app tests, nine Node tool checks and production build pass**. Isolated browser verified real recorded playback, voice/master mute, pause, subtitles and zero browser TTS/ElevenLabs requests. Node check files renamed `-check.mjs` to prevent Vitest collecting `node:test` suites. Generation caches are ignored; markers prevent accidental spending after failures/timeouts. See [recorded callouts](../docs/ENCIK-VOICE.md). No further generations authorized by this batch; request feedback before regenerating variants.

**Latest: Encik audition round 4 (2026-09-13).** User ranked round 3 #1 best, #3 second, rejected #2 for British drift; #1 sounds too young. User requested further improvement. One authorized request used the same 127-character dialogue/model/seed/guidance, changing description to around sixty with chest resonance, worn texture and measured delivery. Three valid MP3 previews (10.0s, 8.8s, 9.3s) at `.cache/encik-audition/36b76e0cf1bd/index.html`, with round 3 #1 embedded for comparison. These are newly designed voices, not edits of #1. Follow-up quota: 127 credits for round 4, 490/40000 total used. Four mocked tests pass. Await user feedback before further generation; no saved voice or full batch.

**Latest: Encik audition round 3 (2026-09-13).** User found round 2 accents natural and #2 hostile but insufficiently coarse/crude; explicitly authorized another two-line audition. Retained Singaporean/kopitiam direction, adding grainy rasp, weathered throaty texture, weary irritation and short barks, plus blunter 127-character dialogue. One Voice Design request returned three valid MP3 candidates (7.1s, 7.2s, 6.8s), at `.cache/encik-audition/0731c4fd24ac/index.html`; comparison links to round 2. These are new designed voices, not edits of round 2 #2. Follow-up quota: 127 credits for round 3, 363/40000 total used. Four mocked tests pass. Await user feedback; no voice saved and full batch still on hold.

**Latest: Encik audition round 2 (2026-09-13).** User rejected round 1 accents: 1/3 British-sounding, 2 slightly Hong Kong-ish, and explicitly approved one more small set. Changed only the voice description to everyday colloquial Singapore English / understated kopitiam conversation; same two lines, seed, guidance and model. One API request returned three valid MP3 candidates (8.0s, 6.8s, 8.0s), saved at `.cache/encik-audition/7ce08f42e116/index.html`, with a link to round 1. Follow-up usage confirmed 118 credits for round 2, 236/40000 total used. Four mocked tests pass. Await user feedback before any further generation or saving a voice. Full game callout batch remains on hold.

**Latest: paid-plan Encik audition succeeded (2026-09-13).** User upgraded to Starter and authorized retrying the same two-line audition. One Voice Design v3 request returned three valid mono 44.1kHz/128kbps MP3 candidates (7.4s, 8.8s, 7.8s). Listen at `.cache/encik-audition/93f198a2b596/index.html`; MP3s and generated voice IDs are cached alongside it. The immediate quota delta was zero; a subsequent read confirmed **118 credits used of 40,000**, recorded in `usage-followup.json`. Key permissions now suffice. The tool now allows paid plans and rejects Free before generation, while retaining included-quota checks, permanent attempt markers and no automatic retries. Four mocked tests pass. Confirmed prior free-plan denials were archived before the authorized retry. **Wait for the user to pick a candidate before saving a voice or generating the full callout pack.** No game audio changed. See [audition setup](../docs/ENCIK-AUDITION.md).

**Latest: trackpad aim toggle (2026-09-13).** Q toggles the existing human aim latch, while RMB still holds aim. Key-repeat does not retrigger it; reload, weapon swap, pause and control handoff clear it. The on-screen Aim button and Q use the same guarded function and are ignored during AI control, death, vehicle use or reloading. Pilot aim decisions and action application are unchanged. Shared weapon HUD and practice/arena/expedition control guides show Q. Build and 14 focused pointer/pilot tests pass; `pnpm test:fps:aim-toggle` verified released-Q scoped firing, repeat suppression, RMB hold, reload/switch/pause reset and AI isolation with all eight targets cleared.

**Latest: Encik radio, comms history and ADS recovery (2026-09-13).** Added 48 fictional Singaporean radio lines for combat, reloads, supplies, AI movement/stuck recovery and match events. Installed local English TTS prefers en-SG; subtitles/log entries survive voice mute. No remote TTS required. A shared cooldown/priority director prevents speech queues and repeated frame-rate requests; player AI can request contact/moving/stuck through its bounded action contract. FPS and expedition share a timestamped, channel-filtered, expandable 100-entry speech/kill/system log, carried with the voice preference across districts. History stays put when scrolled up and resets with a round. Arena entries use the existing public kill feed; this is session history, not LAN text chat. Reproduced another ADS loop after pause/resume: transient scope occlusion caused target switching. The pilot now holds its target briefly and, if visibility fails, reacquires at hip for three seconds before trying ADS again. Browser `test:fps:radio` passed all eight kills, muted callout logging, filters/history and mobile width. 213 tests and production build pass. Additional browser checks confirmed installed local speech invocation/mute, fullscreen log bounds, and comms/voice-preference carry across district travel. Physical voice accent/quality depends on installed OS voices.

**Latest: AI player pilot and optional strategy plugins (2026-09-13).** Watch AI play runs an observation-limited local controller through normal player movement, look, fire, reload, pickup and checkpoint functions. Take control restores pointer capture; Escape/Stop AI pauses even with the strategy selector focused. ADS alignment/hysteresis fixes the reproduced scope-toggle stall; browser cleared all eight practice targets. Local and optional LLM strategists share a plugin contract; the new `/api/adventure/pilot-plan` endpoint uses server credentials and `PILOT_MODEL` (default `gpt-5.6-luna`). Restart `pnpm server` for this route. Requests are throttled, abortable and validated against current known waypoints, with local fallback. Expedition checkpoint state carries pilot/strategy mode and resumes after loading. Verified 207 tests and production build, real LLM response and UI selection, pause/takeover, and autonomous loot/checkpoint travel into CBD. Navigation is heuristic; existing squad NPCs have not migrated to the player perception contract, and permanent NPC lives are not implemented. See [AI pilot](../docs/AI-PILOT.md), `pnpm test:fps:pilot`, and `pnpm test:fps:pilot:travel`.

**Open-world review / LAN region crash (2026-09-13).** Reproduced a blank React page when selecting Queenstown on plain LAN HTTP: `learning-guide.ts` still used `crypto.randomUUID()` directly. Raffles shares the same guide. Switched to the shared `randomUuid()` fallback; both-region regressions fail before the fix and pass afterward. Expedition UI smoke passes on both localhost and `http://192.168.65.2:5173`, including map selection, district entry, minimap, input, fullscreen and cleanup. Travel smoke passed all four gateway directions with carried health/armor/ammo/field variants and persistent collected crates. Focused tests and build passed. **Remaining integration gap:** expedition kill feed only updates announcements; neither `ExpeditionGame` nor `updateArena` connects elimination XP to the permanent armory. Expedition state is in memory, solo only, and uses explicit T checkpoint travel. Menus intentionally keep patrols active.

**Latest: SAR optic attachments and PiP (2026-09-13).** Issued SAR now uses the native integrated 1.5× scope; the GLB exports its complete scope/bridge as `sar21-inspired__optic`. The 350 CR level-1 red-dot conversion replaces that assembly with a rail and unmagnified reflex sight. Removing the optic restores the issued setup. Precision lens saves remain compatible and use 1.75× PiP. `weapon-optics.ts` supplies shared shop/game geometry and a reusable 384×384 scope target; peripheral FOV stays unzoomed and the extra world pass runs only for active magnified ADS. Ultimax defaults to an unmagnified reflex. Unit suite passed at 186 tests, then two added asset/render-gating tests passed (188 total); build and `pnpm test:fps:optics` passed. Browser check covers shop purchase/equip/removal and scoped/unscoped rendering, with screenshots in `.cache/fps-handling/`. Rebuild only SAR using Blender `--background --python asset-pack/scripts/build_assets.py -- --sar-only`; this also copies the updated GLB into the app.

**Latest: FPS handling, survival controls and upstream sync (2026-09-13).** Rebased main onto `fb8cc47`; restored all local work and retained upstream's concise README, putting control details in `docs/PROJECT-GUIDE.md`. New shared `FpsWeaponHud`, procedural gloved hands and hollow reflex optics keep weapons visible throughout smooth ADS. Reload keyframes remove/reseat magazines and add an empty-reload action; mechanical sound follows phase changes and equipped reload speed. Thin crosshair ticks project the same spread cone used by hitscan, widening with sustained fire/movement and recovering after a 0.2s firing break. ADS/crouch reduce spread; support weapons bloom more. Separate white hit/amber kill markers confirm outcomes. Debug survival in ready/pause menus supplies 1×/5×/10× HP, refill and 10% max-HP/s regeneration after 3s without damage, for practice/solo/expeditions. Session storage preserves settings across zones, medical pickups use the boosted cap, and the solo simulation owns actual health. Host/guest network rooms reject this local debug API. 182 unit tests/build pass; dedicated browser checks cover both ADS optics, tactical/empty reloads, sustained fire, actual solo regeneration/refill/reset; expedition UI passes. New repeatable checks: `pnpm test:fps:handling` and `pnpm test:fps:survival` with a separate Chrome profile on port 9228 and Vite 5175 (override FPS_APP_ORIGIN to test LAN HTTP).

**Validation limit:** the full `test:fps` regression completed all eight targets on one run but failed its final multi-kill assertion after a reload broke the chain; the assertion now observes announcements during the drill. Subsequent VM runs were inconsistent: one paused mid-drill, and the last was still locked but looking into the sky during the initial target test. The targeted handling/survival and expedition checks passed. Do not report the full FPS smoke as passing; verify it in a stable browser input environment.

**Mouse/network diagnosis resolved by user:** the host browsers lacked macOS Privacy & Security → Local Network permission. The user enabled it and confirmed FPS capture/turning works in the host browser. Inside UTM, the guest Dock can still show a cursor despite browser pointer lock; further web pointer changes are not required for host-browser play. The separate LAN HTTP randomUUID startup crash was also reproduced and fixed as described below.

**Latest: LAN HTTP startup crash fixed (2026-09-13).** Reproduced an entirely empty React page at `http://192.168.65.2:5173/`: `createAdventure()` called `crypto.randomUUID()`, which is unavailable on this insecure origin. Added `src/lib/random-id.ts` with a `getRandomValues` UUID fallback and used it for adventure sessions and voice event IDs. A regression test covers startup, reset IDs and stale-response rejection without `randomUUID`. 169 tests and production build pass. A fresh Chrome session on the actual LAN HTTP address now renders the default page and reaches Marina FPS ready with no exceptions. The user's physical mouse issue remains unverified: the cursor reaches the **guest VM's Dock** while the HUD still reports MOUSE LOCKED. Host-browser testing was blocked by the startup crash; do not claim that fixing page loading fixes UTM mouse delivery.

**Latest: mouse capture bypass fix (2026-09-13).** Removed `(pointer: fine)` from FPS input selection. Actual pointer events distinguish mouse from touch/pen; mouse play always waits for real pointer lock. Touch-to-mouse input pauses for recapture. Entry and animation guards prevent mouse play without lock, including a suppressed `pointerlockchange`. Both FPS UIs display capture status beside health/armor. 168 unit tests pass; browser checks cover coarse-device mouse capture, denied capture, native touch dragging, mouse handoff, missed lock notification, multi-turn heading, expedition/fullscreen/mobile. Physical UTM delivery is still a separate user verification; do not claim a synthetic browser test proves host cursor capture.

**Latest: local FPS minimap (2026-09-13).** `FpsMinimap.tsx` is reused by practice, expeditions and LAN. It reuses driving's existing road data and `minimapProjection`; regional stamp/companion map markup remains separate. The SVG follows a local 180m window, points the arrow along camera yaw, shows surviving practice targets/parked vehicles or expedition loot/checkpoints, and highlights the planned next exit. LAN receives no opponent markers. HUD publication remains 10Hz and there is no additional renderer or external request. Unit suite: 167 passing; production build passes. Browser checks pass for FPS target removal, view direction, expedition maps/fullscreen/mobile, car/helicopter play and two-browser LAN with opponents hidden. Pointer/browser checks use integer mouse deltas because the MouseEvent constructor rounds movement to whole pixels.

**Current integration (2026-09-13):** rebased multiplayer/bot-role/expedition work onto `dbeb858`. SingaporeMap now previews checkpoint routes during expeditions and follows actual zone arrivals; outside expeditions it retains upstream region selection. New expeditions start in the selected district. App keeps a stable expedition component while `ExpeditionGame` owns per-zone scene replacement and persistent field loot. Route selection must never remount that session or invoke remote travel. 163 unit tests and build pass, along with expedition UI, four-direction travel, upstream three-region walk/drive/map/mobile and two-browser LAN gameplay checks. See [connected districts](../docs/WORLD-ZONES.md), [LAN setup](../docs/LAN-ARENA.md), [role plugins](../docs/arena-plugins.md), and [feature parity audit](../docs/FEATURE-PARITY.md). FPS local minimaps were added in the subsequent pass described above. The entries below document earlier milestones and their then-current limitations.

Last updated: 2026-09-13. Start by reading this file, `.agents/PLAN.md`, and `README.md`, then inspect the checkout and any applicable `AGENTS.md` instructions.

Regional education added: `src/data/raffles-guide.ts` and `queenstown-guide.ts` each contain six source-checked cards covering all 11/eight game stops. Shared catalog now has 18 topics. `RegionGuide.tsx` and `learning-guide.ts` bridge current position/stamps into an education-only companion; they cannot mutate game state. Queenstown/Raffles reset remounts the panel and clears history, while region switches cancel requests. Backend accepts all three region snapshots but only Marina may propose objective changes. Luna text and GPT-Live-1 voice remain shared. Live browser verified Queenstown library and Boat Quay answers with unchanged stamps; physical microphone quality remains untested. Theme-to-stop mappings are not surveyed landmark coordinates.

Latest model choice supersedes earlier Astra runtime instructions: use `gpt-5.6-luna` for companion text interpretation and delegated transcripts, as requested by the user. Speech stays `gpt-live-1`; no automatic fallback. UI and server tests identify Luna. Astra remains the build tool, and historical Astra test results below are not Luna verification.

Luna browser failure resolved: a stale frontend returned 404 for API requests while backend port 3001 succeeded. Restart `pnpm dev` after proxy configuration changes (and `pnpm server` after server changes). Live Luna education/closer/named/skip now verified in browser; 109 unit tests and build pass. A missing-route error now gives explicit restart guidance instead of a generic model failure.

Navigation simplification: Joyride and fixed-camera Target practice are removed from the app. Region Walk/Drive, Street View and Marina FPS remain. Armory is reachable only from the Marina FPS briefing/pause screen’s Open armory button, not the sidebar; FPS remains selected while shopping. Historical prototype source remains unmounted. Browser shop scripts enter FPS before opening the shop.

Location/UI follow-up: only Marina Bay, Raffles Place and Queenstown remain selectable. `SingaporeMap.tsx` supplies a local SVG overview and central inset, linked to the same selection handler with click/keyboard controls; no Maps calls. Reset labels disclose stamp/history clearing, Privacy describes region/mode progress loss, The idea covers education/fullscreen, and Joyride is correctly labelled a 240 m checkpoint run. Motor Pool no longer exposes weapon attachment controls; level 50 has maximum-level copy. Tests cover the location list, map selection and keyboard access, About/Privacy, separate armory panels, and maximum-level wording.

Independent follow-up copy review is clear within its reviewed scope after fixing Target practice’s reset label and specifying Marina FPS credit rewards. Verification: 108 tests, production build, companion/copy/armory browser checks and all three regions/map selection/keyboard/mobile checks pass; no Maps calls or uncaught browser errors. Existing Three.js chunk-size warning remains nonblocking.

**Combined companion/FPS checkpoint:** rebased the adventure companion, educational guide and objective highlights onto `2b8257c` (FPS armory/progression/vehicles/fullscreen). Preserved both sets of styles, handoff history, and privacy disclosures for local armory storage and optional OpenAI interaction. Combined unit suite: **106 tests passing**, production build passing with the existing nonblocking Three.js chunk-size warning. Earlier counts below describe individual milestones.

**Current integrated checkpoint:** rebased FPS, armory, XP, vehicle and asset-pack work onto `2f27af2` while preserving all three region refinements and reference caches. Immersive fullscreen is now available through the toolbar or F; Escape pauses/releases capture, and denied native fullscreen has an expanded-view fallback. The session remains intact when changing screen mode. Current verification: **75 tests + production build**, with local FPS/shop/vehicle/fullscreen browser workflows passing during this integration. Aircraft clearance heights also cover the expanded Marina structures. `pnpm test:fullscreen` is the new browser check; see `docs/ARMORY.md`.

**Latest armory / progression / pointer-capture pass:** Field exchange is available in the sidebar. The FPS session now also includes Utility 01 driving, Falcon 01 flight, E entry/exit, chase cameras, a landing pad and five separately equipped vehicle wraps. It includes 27 permanent items, stronger premium variants, skins, attachments, ILBV/LBS-inspired rigs and separate armor inserts. Level-gated purchasing, 50 XP levels, rank badges and timed double/triple/multi-kill callouts are connected to FPS target health and completion rewards. Optional counter-fire applies actual armor/health damage, dodge warnings and defeat. Desktop gameplay now requires successful pointer lock; Escape releases and pauses, and denied capture prevents play. Wallet/XP/inventory/loadout persist locally; no real payments or backend. See [docs/ARMORY.md](../docs/ARMORY.md) for balance, architecture and sources.

Current verification: **47 tests + production build pass**. Both `pnpm test:fps` and `pnpm test:armory` passed against isolated local Chrome, including all-eight completion, XP/level-up/callouts, shop purchases/equipment/save reload, armor absorption/defeat, mouse confinement and capture-denial regression, mobile layout and mode cleanup. No uncaught browser errors or map requests. Preview/FPS screenshots were inspected; `.cache/` holds local evidence. pnpm 11 and the 14-day dependency cooldown remain intact; no dependencies were added.

**Latest local FPS integration:** Marina Bay now has a separate **Marina FPS** sidebar mode. It reuses the authored map and obstacle collision, adds two local GLB weapons, eight targets, pointer-lock/free movement, sprint/crouch/jump, automatic fire, optical aim overlay, recoil/effects, magazines/reserves, animated reload poses, switching, pause/reset and timed accuracy scoring. Touch controls and touch-device drag-look are included. Desktop pointer lock is mandatory. Files: `src/components/FpsGame.tsx`, `src/game/fps-engine.ts`, `fps-rules.ts`, `fps-raycast.ts`; six portable GLBs under `public/models/field-kit/`. Default Marina walk/drive and the old fixed-camera Target practice remain available. No live map requests, capture spending or new runtime dependencies. Keep pnpm 11.22.0 and the strict 14-day cooldown.

Verification for FPS: **26 tests and production build pass**. Local Chrome smoke passed model loading, target hits, ammo/reload with pause, switching, movement, aim, all-eight-target completion, reset, 390px layout and mode cleanup, with zero map requests and no uncaught browser exceptions. Gameplay/aim/completion screenshots were visually inspected. Actual touchscreen play and physical-device performance remain unmeasured.

FPS is an arcade range with optional target counter-fire and player/armor damage; it has no navigating enemy AI, multiplayer or skeletal hand rig. Viewmodel lenses are opaque; aiming uses a separate overlay. Ground-plane jumping does not let players vault building colliders. FPS dynamic shadows are disabled and pixel ratio is capped at 1.35 for this VM. `pnpm test` includes ammo/occlusion/layout checks; `pnpm test:fps` runs the dedicated local Chrome smoke workflow described in README. Commit/copy the public GLBs with the code; the game does not depend on the asset workshop directory or Blender.

## Newest feature: Marina adventure companion

Educational extension: `src/data/singapore-guide.ts` contains eight reviewed, source-linked fact cards and reflection prompts. `server/adventure-api.ts` adds structured `learn` intent/topic ID selection to the existing Astra endpoint; GPT-Live delegates educational questions too. The shared client validates topic IDs and session/revision before showing a card/returning its facts for speech, without calling the game mutation path. `AdventureCompanion.tsx` adds quick questions and source cards. Ask “tell me about the museum” versus “take me to the museum” to check the learning/travel distinction. Questions about Queenstown/Raffles Place work from Marina; those regions do not yet mount the companion. Keep facts curated, source links trusted and operational information (hours/prices/exhibitions) out of scope unless verified. Current unit/build baseline: 79 tests passing; no new dependencies or Maps calls.

Objective visibility was strengthened: named purple/white minimap diamond/halo and straight-line guide, plus a world-space purple beacon, ground ring and recolored active collectible. `src/game/objective-highlight.ts` owns decorative resources/material restoration; do not change collision/arrival behavior. Its selection tracks the same active ID as the HUD. 74 tests and browser regressions pass.

Read `docs/ADVENTURE.md` before changing text/voice behavior. `pnpm server` loads private `OPENAI_API_KEY` and starts the two API endpoints on loopback 3001; `pnpm dev` proxies them. Never put the key in a VITE variable. Requested models are exactly `gpt-6-astra` and `gpt-live-1`; preserve the separate Live protocol and shared local apply logic. No new dependencies. Game geometry, routes and Google image cache/ledger are unchanged.

`adventure.ts` owns objective IDs, request/revision/session guards and deterministic closer selection; `MarinaGame.tsx` feeds position/collection and draws active HUD/minimap. Reset remounts the panel and invalidates requests. Objective changes must never mutate collected stamps or bypass existing arrival checks. `adventure-client.ts` is shared by text and voice, and only acknowledges a game-applied update. `live-voice.ts` owns microphone/WebRTC/delegation/cleanup; never run actions from transcript-gap heuristics. Origin checks are not authentication: add access control before public deployment. Browser QA commands and synthetic-audio caveats are in `docs/ADVENTURE.md`.

Verified: **72 tests and production build pass**, live Astra text works for closer/museum/skip, and a synthetic spoken request completed real GPT-Live transcription → Astra → applied objective → spoken output. Real microphone and human listening quality remain manual checks. Per-delegation cancellation now blocks stale applies after spontaneous voice closure or newer delegation, even if fetch ignores abort. Pending transcript/reply timers fail back to text; old session cleanup cannot clear a new session’s audio. Secret scan found no OpenAI key in commit candidates or production assets. Keep test input audio streaming after the phrase (the live voice harness pads it), otherwise its media clock can stop before commentary is acknowledged.

## Latest pass: Static references and model refinement

User authorized 25 Static images per region (75 total) to improve model quality, with one refining subagent per world. Root's new `scripts/capture-static-references.mjs` uses the private Static-enabled `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, never the browser-only demo key. Plans: `reconstruction/marina-static-quality-plan.json`, `reconstruction/raffles-static-quality-plan.json`, `reconstruction/queenstown-static-quality-plan.json`. Run `pnpm references:static --plan <path> --dry-run` first. References are original JPEGs plus individual source/camera/checksum/review manifests, retained outside public assets. Reusing stored panorama metadata avoids additional metadata calls. Regional allowance baselines/caps are in the ledger; see newest PLAN section for authority and usage rather than older figures below. Preserve independent driving-camera behavior and the current world bounds/objective counts during this quality pass.

Capture completed: all 75 images saved, no failures, zero metadata requests; all three regional allowances are exhausted. Ledger total is 105 conservative Static attempts, not 105 successful image downloads (98 image attempts plus seven metadata attempts). Cache-only reruns require no credentials/network. New image review: Marina 19 accepted/six limited, Raffles 25 accepted, Queenstown 23 accepted/two limited. Read `docs/MARINA-EXPANSION.md`, Marina `references/static-quality-review.md`, and both other `REGION.md` documents for the image-to-model mapping. All three models now have richer structural/material detail while preserving their extents and 14/11/eight objectives. Full reference cache: 285 images. Do not reinterpret the remaining global safety cap as authorization to fetch more Static images.

Final quality-pass verification: **48 tests across 15 files, production build and all three region browser/camera/mobile checks pass**. Browser checks made zero Maps requests and had no uncaught errors. Targeted model close-ups were reviewed; all 285 reference checksums and the credential scan pass. The existing Three.js chunk-size warning is nonblocking. No dependencies changed; retain pnpm 11 and strict 14-day release age. Remaining work: human full-objective play-through, actual-phone performance, camera occlusion, NPC/traffic behavior and geographic refinement, then deployment/video. All sections below record earlier milestones; their quotas and counts are superseded by this section and the newest PLAN entry.

## Earlier scope: all three regions expanded

Completed the further large reference-and-map expansion with one modeling agent per region; browser operations remain serialized. Current worlds: Marina **726 × 616 / 14 stamps**, Raffles **580 × 399 / 11 stamps**, Queenstown **520 × 424 / eight stamps**. Latest pass added 114 screenshots; the full portable cache contains **210 images** (72 Marina, 64 Raffles, 74 Queenstown), all checksum-valid. Read the newest PLAN section and scoped region documents first. `pnpm references:inventory` is an offline checksum/review inventory; keep the cache and manifests together and preserve rejected captures. Queenstown now uses bounds-derived minimap projection and exported road paths, matching Marina/Raffles; all region HUD stamp counts must remain dynamic.

Latest capture plans: `reconstruction/marina-district-browser-plan.json`, `reconstruction/raffles-expansion-browser-plan.json`, `reconstruction/queenstown-district-browser-plan.json`. Marina/Raffles are fully cached; Queenstown saved 34/40 before stopping, so a full run without `--dry-run` would intentionally fetch missing images. Do not blindly rerun it. Earlier Queenstown plans retain original/replacement frames and their review outcomes. No new dependencies; pnpm 11 and strict two-week cooldown remain intact.

Verification at handoff: **41 tests, production build, three-region browser/camera/mobile checks and cache checksums pass**. No live Maps calls occur during game checks. Credential scan passed. The build still emits the nonblocking Three.js chunk-size warning. Remaining follow-ups are human full-objective play-through, actual-phone performance, camera collision/occlusion and geographic refinement; current agents' expansion work is complete.

## Current entry point: three regions and independent car camera

Raffles Place is integrated alongside Marina and the richer Queenstown estate. Read `reconstruction/raffles-place/REGION.md` and `reconstruction/queenstown/REGION.md` for geometry, references and review limitations. App uses location ID for default selection, so adding a location no longer changes the default via an array index. `src/game/drive-camera.ts` is the shared driving orbit helper: drag must never modify vehicle heading while in Drive. All three controllers use independent look state, reset it on travel-mode changes, and recenter only while moving after an idle delay. Preserve this behavior in new controllers. Browser smoke covers stationary/moving drag, no accidental steering, recenter/reset/mode switching in all three regions with test-only WebGL camera observation.

**Capture reliability:** serialize capture, selection AND browser smoke runs; do not switch tabs while capturing. Background Street View may report the right POV with old pixels. `capture-readiness.mjs` and the runner enforce foreground/POV/zoom/overlay/repaint checks and detect exact duplicate images; still inspect every frame. Older rejected files are retained and marked in manifests/region notes, replacements use new IDs. Transfer complete region reference directories plus plans/ledger, never environment credentials. Raffles batch: `reconstruction/raffles-browser-plan.json`; Queenstown expansion and replacement plans are in `reconstruction/`. Use `--dry-run` first; cache-only reruns make no requests. Source cache is not copied to public game assets.

## Previous milestone: two region games

**Latest allowance update:** user renewed the remaining Static allowance to **50 images**. The ledger preserves baseline 8 and all history, with `maxAdditionalImages: 65` (15 used + 50 remaining). .agents/PLAN.md is authoritative; older budget figures below are historical. README intentionally omits limits.

The user explicitly expanded work to **Marina Bay and Queenstown** and requested subagents. Marina now spans 556 × 466 game units, with outer road connections and nine collectibles. Queenstown is a separate 368 × 288-unit estate with open void decks, station/train, shops, library-inspired garden and five collectibles. Both are authored compressed interpretations. Prior Marina-only scope notes below are superseded; Tampines/Toa Payoh are still future region maps.

`App.tsx` uses `hasRegionGame`/`regionModeLabel` from `src/game/region-selection.ts` to open the corresponding `MarinaGame` or `QueenstownGame`. Queenstown owns `queenstown-scene.ts`/`queenstown-collision.ts`; Marina uses its expanded bounds/`MARINA_MAP_ROADS`. The Marina minimap is bounds-derived using `src/game/minimap.ts`; HUD stamp count is dynamic. Keyed region switching disposes the outgoing scene.

New cached references: 8 Marina browser screenshots at four new positions; 4 Queenstown screenshots at two positions. Plans: `reconstruction/marina-expansion-browser-plan.json` and `reconstruction/queenstown-browser-plan.json`. Use `pnpm marina:browser-capture --plan <plan-path> --dry-run` before any capture; complete-cache reruns use no requests. Source directories remain `reconstruction/<region>/references/`; preserve metadata/galleries/reports. Budget events now carry the correct region, browser events remain excluded from Static limits, and **35 additional Static images remain**.

Read `docs/MARINA-EXPANSION.md` and `reconstruction/queenstown/REGION.md` for specifics, sources and limitations. `pnpm test:browser` checks both regions with local Vite/Chrome (loopback debugging port 9223 by default; `REGION_APP_ORIGIN`/`CHROME_DEBUG_ORIGIN` overrides). Tests use their own tab, do not load Google Maps, and place screenshots in `.cache/browser-checks/`. Keep checksums, secrets exclusions, pnpm11 and the strict14-day cooldown intact. No public deployment is implied.

**Newest gameplay geometry pass:** cached screenshots now inform angular museum shells/supports/lily pond, Fullerton-inspired stone arcade, roof louvers/masts/stays, entrance canopy/blue fins/bollards, finer paving/rail braces, curved shade beams, benches and planting/shade trees. `reconstruction/marina-bay/references/GAME-DETAILS.md` maps observations to changes. Code: `src/game/marina-scene.ts`; static details remain batched and ground obstacles use existing collision handling. All 20 tests/build and browser movement/reset/mobile checks pass. No capture/API spending; Static allowance remains 35. Other locations remain future work, Marina-only focus unchanged.

**Release handoff:** this milestone includes the game improvements, demo-key browser capture workflow, corrected Static-only budget accounting, batch plan, 15 cached reference JPEGs, 9 cached browser PNGs, metadata/checksums, galleries and benchmark reports. Clone/pull the repository to transfer these references; do not recapture. Private `.env`, model caches and older rejected/source captures remain excluded. The credential scan found no configured API-key values in the files prepared for commit. Remaining work: visual feedback, full collectible completion/actual-phone checks, then deployment/video; no public deployment yet.

## Most recent: batch workflow and corrected limits

**Screenshots do not consume Static API allowances**, per the user's explicit clarification. `api-budget.mjs` and usage reporting now separate them. Static: 15/50 additional images used, **35 remaining**; 23 total images + 7 metadata = 30/1000 conservative Static attempts. Browser: 9 screenshots, 5 panorama loads/changes, 4 selections, separately tracked. Historical shared-limit figures below are superseded; never reset the ledger.

`pnpm marina:browser-capture --batch --dry-run` validates the editable `reconstruction/marina-browser-plan.json` without requests. `--batch` resumes eight configured views across four reviewed centers, reusing panoramas by source, caching PNG/metadata/checksums and generating timing reports/contact sheet. Per-run screenshot bounds are operational safeguards, not Static quota. Cache mismatch stops; use a new view ID for changed camera settings. Fresh captures require local Vite + Chrome debugging; complete-cache reruns are offline. Details in `reconstruction/marina-bay/references/WORKFLOW.md`.

Measured: 8/8 screenshots in 21.826s, four panorama loads/changes, zero Static calls/failures, ~11.4 MiB. Cache rerun: 33ms, eight hits, zero browser/network. All images visually reviewed and metadata annotated; source dates span 2012/2021/2022. **20 tests + build pass**. Keep the reference folder, reports, gallery and plan together for cross-machine reuse. No new game geometry in this pass.

## Latest steering — read first

**Browser/demo-key capture now verified:** Vite explicitly maps `GOOGLE_MAPS_DEMO_API_KEY` to the existing frontend browser-key slot when set; otherwise uses `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`. This exposes only the intended browser credential, not all `.env` variables. Static scripts continue using the original key. Restart/reload on key changes; do not print keys.

Run `pnpm marina:browser-capture` for the single configured north-bay view. It uses `scripts/pages/capture-streetview.html` served by Vite and a separate local Chrome debugging tab; blocks Static endpoints; caches a 1280×900 PNG plus metadata/checksum; leaves attribution/date intact. A fresh capture needs Vite and Chrome debug port 9223 (configurable `MARINA_APP_ORIGIN` / `CHROME_DEBUG_ORIGIN`); a cached rerun needs neither a browser nor credentials. Screenshot was visually checked with the demo key and cache rerun made zero requests. No new dependencies. Build/17 tests passed.

**Latest counters:** 36 conservative ledger entries; 23 Static images unchanged; 1 browser panorama load and 1 screenshot reservation newly recorded. Additional-image allowance **16/50 used, 34 remaining** across both capture paths. These override earlier counts below. Screenshot reservations are not Google API calls; Dynamic Street View loads may be billed independently. Cached screenshots are in the same portable reference folder.

**Latest detail pass:** colors and materials now follow reviewed references; Sands proportions use published dimensions at 0.54 landmark scale (ground layout still compressed). More detailed paving/railings/palms/planting/lights, Shoppes podium/roof, tower facades and museum pond/supports are implemented. Static box details are instanced. Current verification: **17 tests + build**, browser movement/reset/mobile smoke; full road clearance and spawn/stamp clearance are unit-tested.

**New capture authority/cache:** up to 50 additional Marina Bay images authorized; **15 used, 35 remain**. All 15 JPEGs and per-view JSON are saved in `reconstruction/marina-bay/references/`, intentionally eligible for Git/transfer (not public runtime assets). Include this folder on the next commit or cross-machine transfer so agents do not re-query it. Each frame has heading/pitch/FOV, size and SHA-256. The reference README explains actual coverage and source dates (2012, 2021, 2022).

**Updated budget:** `pnpm marina:usage` now reports **34 total attempts, 23 Static images**, 966 conservative attempts remaining. `api-usage.json.imageAllowance` enforces a separate 50-image cap from baseline 8, including the first three previews. This supersedes the older 13-attempt figures below; never reset either counter. `pnpm marina:references` and `pnpm marina:references --surroundings` reuse the complete cache with zero requests, but may fetch missing files—transfer the cache first. No key is needed to play the game.

The user clarified: **3D game rendering of Marina Bay in Joyride's low-poly art style**, not photographs or depth-warped imagery. The active default is now `src/components/MarinaGame.tsx`, using authored solid geometry in `src/game/marina-scene.ts`. Saved photos informed waterfront details, but the map is compressed and authored, **not automatically reconstructed or surveyed**.

**Confirmed scope:** eventually apply this location-specific walkable/drivable 3D treatment to **all locations**, including Tampines, Toa Payoh and Queenstown. **Marina Bay is the only current implementation focus.** Establish and validate the approach there before expanding; existing generic Joyride presets do not count as completed location maps.

Current game: modeled Sands/SkyPark, lotus-like museum, Helix crossing, city skyline, palm promenade, bay road loop, visible mint car, walk/run/drive, obstacle collisions, five collectible stamps, minimap and reset. `src/game/marina-collision.ts` provides subdivided AABB collision and wall sliding. The historical `MarinaWorld.tsx` depth viewer is unmounted; assets/pipeline remain for reference. Do not restore it as the default.

Validation: production build and **14 tests pass**. Local browser smoke checks passed rendering, walk/drive movement, reset, mobile width, no uncaught errors and zero live Static requests; walk/drive screenshots inspected. Full five-stamp completion, full road-lap verification, actual-phone performance and portable end-to-end tests remain open. A non-blocking Three.js chunk-size warning remains.

Controls: click canvas; WASD walks, drag looks, Shift runs. Drive gives a chase camera and visible car; W/S throttle/reverse, A/D steer, Space brakes. Switching modes preserves location. Reset clears stamps and distance. Movement is flat-ground arcade handling, with water/building obstacles but no gravity, slopes, suspension or camera collision. Distances are game-scale estimates.

No new API or image-generation calls were made for this pass; ledger stays **13 attempts (8 images)**. No key, capture, model inference or saved photo asset is needed to play the new game. Keep pnpm 11.22.0 and strict 14-day cooldown. Never reset the capture ledger or print/commit environment secrets.

Next: get visual feedback; refine landmark proportions/reference fidelity; validate all stamps and the road loop; improve camera/vehicle/accessibility; then expand other locations only after Marina is accepted. See the top of `.agents/PLAN.md`. No public deployment or video yet.

Portable setup remains `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm marina:usage`, `pnpm dev`, using Node 22.12+ and pnpm 11.22.0. If absent, bootstrap with `npx --yes pnpm@11.22.0`. Never copy the original machine's absolute cache paths or process IDs. The repository's initial published milestone is `a8a6eba`; inspect checkout status for subsequent work.

## Historical handoff below

The remaining sections preserve prior implementation history and detailed setup. Statements describing the depth viewer as the current/default scene, no collisions, 11 tests, or improving depth as the highest priority are historical and superseded by the section above. Setup, secret handling and budget constraints still apply.

## Product context (previous depth milestone)

Two-person Singapore hackathon prototype, built with Astra as an engineering collaborator. The user wants realistic, playable experiences in everyday Singapore as well as tourist destinations. Driving and an NS-inspired FPS were the original ideas. A deployed URL and 90-second video are the final event deliverables; neither has been produced yet.

**Latest user clarification:** Build real 3D scenes from street-level images of Singapore and allow continuous walking/driving inside them. The user explicitly corrected the earlier panorama-viewer interpretation. GPT-Image-2.5 may help if useful; a bitmap alone is not the desired result.

**Current implementation:** Marina 3D is a working small-area depth reconstruction from four waterfront images, with continuous walk/drive controls. It is not a complete district or a metric photogrammetry model. The app also retains live Street View and the original procedural game modes; those are separate experiences.

**Latest authority and scope:** The user confirmed permission to reconstruct Street View imagery and selected **Marina Bay first**. Do not ask for permission again. They also imposed a **1,000 Static API query limit**, requested persistent accounting, and asked to minimize images.

**Latest work:** `scripts/capture-marina.mjs` captures one reviewed panorama in four directions; `scripts/reconstruct-marina.mjs` estimates local depth, stitches sector edges, and writes geometry/texture assets; `src/components/MarinaWorld.tsx` provides continuous walk/drive controls. The generated scene is included in `public/reconstruction/marina-bay/` and starts by default. It needs no Maps key or model inference to play. Capture is from **February 2012**, not current imagery. Scale/ground are approximate; exploration is bounded to a 4-unit radius. There is no true vehicle physics or mesh collision system.

**Key issue resolved:** the latest key in `.env` succeeded. No need to ask the user to enable Static API again. `reconstruction/api-usage.json` currently records **13 capture attempts: 8 Static images, 4 Static metadata requests, and 1 Maps JavaScript panorama selection**. Four early image downloads were an unsuitable indoor panorama; they are not in the scene. Check `pnpm marina:usage` for the current count. Preserve the ledger; never reset it. No more image calls are needed to run/build the current scene. See `reconstruction/README.md`.

## Explicit user preferences

- Use **pnpm 11**, currently pinned to **11.22.0**.
- Enforce a **two-week minimum dependency release age** (`20160` minutes).
- Preserve `minimumReleaseAgeStrict: true` and the lockfile. Do not bypass the cooldown to solve an install issue.
- Keep the plan/history and handoff useful for agents on different computers.
- Do not overwrite the user's private environment settings or publish their credentials.

## Transfer the work first

Repository: `git@github.com:ryanpeh/astra-hackathon.git`, branch `main`. The owner requested an initial commit and upstream push of this prototype, its generated assets, and these documents. Use the published branch as the transfer source and run `git status` before starting new work. Source images/caches and `.env` are intentionally excluded; generated scene assets are included so another machine can play immediately.

Include: `src/`, `scripts/`, `public/reconstruction/marina-bay/`, `reconstruction/api-usage.json`, `reconstruction/marina-bay.capture.json`, `reconstruction/README.md`, `index.html`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `README.md`, `.agents/PLAN.md`, `.agents/HANDOFF.md`.

Exclude: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.cache/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, actual `.env` / `.env.local`, local browser profiles, and temporary screenshots/scripts. Generated public scene assets are portable and should be included. If rebuilding depth locally, copy the four approved images plus `capture.json` from the ignored `reconstruction/marina-bay/source/` through the owner's normal file transfer process; do not recapture unnecessarily. Do not transfer the rejected indoor set as reconstruction input. Obtain any required keys separately. Never copy the first machine's npm cache paths, process IDs, or browser sessions into setup instructions.

## Bring up a new machine

1. Install Node **22.12+** (a supported even-numbered LTS release is appropriate).
2. Make pnpm **11.22.0** available. If it is absent, use `npx --yes pnpm@11.22.0` as the launcher for the commands below; npm here bootstraps pnpm, it does not install the app dependencies.
3. From the project root:

```sh
pnpm --version
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

If pnpm is not installed globally:

```sh
npx --yes pnpm@11.22.0 install --frozen-lockfile
npx --yes pnpm@11.22.0 test
npx --yes pnpm@11.22.0 build
npx --yes pnpm@11.22.0 dev
```

Read the URL Vite prints; it normally uses port 5173 but may select another if occupied. No absolute filesystem paths, OS-specific shell commands, global pnpm install, or old running processes are required.

### Google Maps setup

Create `.env.local` from `.env.example` and set:

```dotenv
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_browser_key
```

Vite also reads `.env`; `.env.local` overrides a conflicting `.env` value. `.env.example` is documentation only. Restart Vite after configuring the key. Both real environment files are ignored by Git.

Enable Maps JavaScript API and billing. Restrict the browser key to this API and the relevant HTTP referrers. `http://localhost:5173/*` and `http://127.0.0.1:5173/*` are different referrers; allow whichever you use, plus the deployed site. A browser key is public in the client bundle by design. Never use a secret OpenAI key in a `VITE_*` variable.

The first machine has a user-provided `.env`; its value is deliberately not in this handoff. The app now starts in **Marina 3D**, using local generated assets regardless of key presence. The key is only needed for the separate live Street View mode or recapturing sources. Source images are processed locally; no image-generation API is used.

## Architecture and extension points

Historical scaffold state was in React/in-memory refs. The current app adds the local armory save and FPS/collision described above; there is still no database, authentication, backend or multiplayer. External services are Google Maps and Google Fonts, plus a model-weight download for the local reconstruction build. Authorized captures and derived scene assets now exist. The browser loads only generated assets in Marina 3D; the model runs offline at build time. See the reconstruction README for limitations.

## What was verified

- Current Marina build: local inference completed, 11 tests and production build passed, and browser checks verified scene loading, walk/drive translation, reset, mobile width, no uncaught errors, and **zero live Static API requests**. Screenshots of the real scene were inspected. Some image stretching is visible and expected from this single-center depth approximation.
- Initial scaffold: production build, physics tests, desktop WebGL/game controls/target hits, missing-key view, and mobile overflow checks passed.
- Latest Street View pass: production build and six unit tests passed; browser rendered content for all 12 starting viewpoints; look-right, actual forward panorama changes, and recenter worked; no horizontal overflow at a 390 px mobile viewport.
- **Historical auxiliary-viewer limitation:** screenshots before the final key update showed a Google configuration warning. The final key successfully fetched valid Static images, and the generated Marina scene was visually checked. Recheck the separate live viewer if needed; do not confuse its earlier warning with the current local-assets scene. The agent did not modify Cloud settings.
- Browser checks used a temporary headless Chrome session on the first machine. Those temporary scripts are not a project dependency or a portable test suite. Recheck with a normal browser on your own origin/key.
- No hosted deployment, actual-phone performance test, or runtime Astra API test has been completed.

## Fast manual acceptance check

1. Reload: Marina 3D should load the waterfront scene without requiring a key or making a Static API request. Click the canvas, use WASD, drag to look, switch Walk/Drive, and reset. The gold ring marks the exploration limit; distances are approximate.
2. For the optional live viewer, choose Street View and try destinations/tabs. This uses the configured key and separate Maps JavaScript traffic.
3. In that viewer, turn left/right, step along the road, and recenter. Step buttons may be disabled if no connected photograph exists in the current direction. Rotate to find a path.
4. Switch to Joyride: start, hold W/up, steer with A/D, brake with S/Space, pause/resume/reset, and complete all three gates.
5. Switch to Target practice: hit all five orange targets and reset.
6. Test a narrow/mobile viewport. Ensure the Google attribution is not obscured and the app does not overflow horizontally.
7. With no key, confirm the no-key demo still works. If testing an invalid key, never print it in logs or commit it.

## Known limits and next steps

- The small four-image Marina proof of concept now works. Next validate depth at more viewing angles and decide whether to extend with translated captures, calibrated geometry/scale, and actual collision. Do not silently spend more image quota. The current asset format is JSON BufferGeometry plus JPEG, not GLB.
- Image generation is optional for texture/appearance completion. Its output does not replace geometry, camera calibration, collision, or validation of spatial consistency. No GPT-Image-2.5 endpoint/access has been verified; use the actual event-provided capability rather than inventing a model/API contract.
- A Google Maps warning was recorded before the final key update. Static API now works; the auxiliary live viewer should be rechecked separately if used in a demo. Preserve source attribution and capture date in the reconstruction.
- Approximate search points are not guaranteed landmark coordinates; Google may snap multiple points to the same panorama. Human curation of heading and distinctness remains useful.
- Street View transitions between capture positions. Do not add fabricated speed/distance claims or imply it supplies depth/collision geometry.
- Test slow networks, failed authorization, unavailable imagery, and rapid viewpoint switching more deeply. The SDK is shared within a page; after changing key restrictions or an authorization failure, a full reload is the reliable recovery path.
- The generic 3D scene varies palette/height, not neighborhood geography. Improving it requires original or suitably licensed data/assets.
- Terms/privacy dialogs are prototype text; keyboard focus trapping and an accessibility pass remain open.
- Highest-value next step: evaluate and improve the bounded depth reconstruction before expanding capture volume. Do not make further panorama navigation the main deliverable. See `.agents/PLAN.md` for acceptance criteria and ordered work.

## Deploy on a new host

Static frontend: install `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, build `pnpm build`, publish `dist`. Configure the Maps key at **build time**, add the deployed referrer to the key, and rebuild after env changes. No SPA path rewrites are currently needed because there are no pathname routes.

Before finishing a change, run relevant tests and `pnpm build`, record what you actually verified in `.agents/PLAN.md`, and update this handoff if setup or architecture changes. Do not claim that a local test proves the public deployment works.
